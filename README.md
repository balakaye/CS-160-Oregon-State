# CS-160-Oregon-State

Hello All,

This is my repo for the intro to programming course4 I took  my freshman year at Oregon State Uni.
This class was a beginner level python course where I learned the basics of back-end programming.
This repo is a timeline for personal use so I can look back at my work in the future and see the progress I make as a programmer.
Please do not copy any of my code for class. 
I apprecitate it.
Keep on coding!
